# issue-tracker
IssueTracker Lite is a realistic, portfolio‑ready web application where users can create projects and track issues (bugs/tasks), comment on them, attach files, assign priorities and statuses, and manage sprints. It’s designed to exercise essential Java + Spring Boot skills end‑to‑end, from backend design to CI/CD and containerized deployment.
